# Analog-Function-Generator
In this repository there is a detailed description of how to build an analog function generator
which can generate Sine, Saw-tooth, Square (with adjustable duty cycle) waves with adjustable amplitude, frequency and a DC shift. The amplitudes can be varied from 0 V to 10 V and frequencies can be varied from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. This project was done by mainly
using op-amps, resistors and capacitors.
